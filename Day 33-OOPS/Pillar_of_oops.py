# There are four pillars of OOPS.abs

# ! Abstraction
# ! Encapsulation
# ! Inheritance
# ! polymorphous


# ! Abstraction 
# Means a thing that is not clear at all. 
# Definition
        # Hiding the implementation details of a class and only showing the essential features to the usr
        # The main code of any class is hide from the user 
        # User don't know the backend of the method(function) or class
        # he just use it and the backend is hide from the user until and unless he himself see the backend
        # overall code is hide from the user 
        # he just call or create object from the class and don't need to see the backend code.





# ! Encapsulation
# definition    
        # Wrapping data and functions into single unit(object)
