# OOPS are Object Oriented Programming
#  means we create real-world models 

#TODO  In OOPS we are trying to create real-life models that can do thing like in reality.
# TODO that models are the object that have attributes to do things and also have methods to do other things

# TODO  1:Attributes are like variables that a particular object have

# TODO  2:Methods are the functions that a particular object can also Do

# TODO  3: we can also create or generate other object from the particular object that we create it earlier


# TODO  4: classes are the template or main blue-print for the particular object 
# TODO  5: Object are the generated models from the classes.

# Example:
# supposes we have a car model like C-259. NOw we create number of cars on that C-295 model . So we can do is

# car1=C_295_model()
# car2=C_295_model()
# car3=C_295_model()
# car4=C_295_model()
# car5=C_295_model()

#  Here we build 5 cars on the model of C-295.
#  Here C-295 is the class which is template and ca1,car2..car5  are the object
#  That's how we create class and their object
