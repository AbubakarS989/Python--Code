# List is the collection of different items
# list are mutable, content can be change
# fully flexible


# An example
data=["ahmad",45,89.34,"A",True,5>2]
print(data)

# Access to list by its indexing from 0
print(data[3]) 

#can change its content
data[1]=10
print(data)

# slicing of list
print(data[1:4]) # 4 is excluded
